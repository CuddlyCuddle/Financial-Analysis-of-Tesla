# Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate basic statistical analysis of stocks using Tesla as an example. For this analysis, a table of basic statistics is created using returns to determine the quality of the stock as an investment. In addition, a small simulation of stock price is conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation assuming that stocks follow a Geometric Distribution.

# Basic Analysis
## About the Analysis
For this analysis, we want to analyze the longer-term returns and the possible returns for Tesla by using the monthly time frame from inception to present (2020-May-1) to determine the possible outcomes of an investment. In addition, the daily data for the price valuation of Tesla stock from 2017-Jan-1 to 2020-May-1 will be used to conduct shorter-term analysis: the reason a truncated dataset will be used is because investor perspective and expectations may have changed in regards to new information. Finally, the data will be segmented in order to determine different possible phases in market change. 

## Price Statistics
Elementary statistics on the price based more on the mathematice methods within the scope of Day trading. 


## Return (%) Statistics
This is an analysis of the returns for the given financial security, Tesla (TSLA) stock, and the returns over a given period. The reason why it is important to track its returns is to develop an understand of the price movements for a relative time frame, in addition to the fact that it allows a comparison of price movements accross different assets. Because it allows a comparison accross different assets, risk analysis and other analysis can be done allowing for the investor to make more informed decisions upon choosing investments and investment strategies. For instance, perhaps the investor is fairly risk adverse, so long as the mean returns for an investment outperforms inflation and the general economic market with relatively low volatily then that would be an optimal choice. However, another invester who is a risk taker, would be willing to make an investment with more volatility as long as the expected returns are relatively greater than other options. 


# Stock Price Simulation
The stock price simulation was done using Brownian motion, and it was compared against the true valuation of the stock and the deterministic projection of the stock valuation over the same period. The deterministic projection assumes that there is a natural upward drift in the valuation and the periods and the volatility determines the "shock" or the error from the deterministic drift. So, certris paribus, holding all else constant, there would be a natural increase in the valuation of a stock due to the devaluation of money (a phenomenon known as inflation).
