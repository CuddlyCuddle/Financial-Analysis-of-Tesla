# Introduction
  In this project, I demonstrate basic statistical analysis of stocks using Tesla as an example. For this analysis, a table of basic statistics is created using returns to determine the quality of the stock as an investment. In addition, a small simulation of stock price is conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation assuming that stocks follow a Geometric Distribution.

# Basic Analysis
## About the Analysis
For this analysis, we want to analyze the longer-term returns and the possible returns for Tesla by using the monthly time frame from inception to present (2020-May-1) to determine the possible outcomes of an investment. In addition, the daily data for the price valuation of Tesla stock from 2017-Jan-1 to 2020-May-1 will be used to conduct shorter-term analysis: the reason a truncated dataset will be used is because investor perspective and expectations may have changed in regards to new information. Finally, the data will be segmented in order to determine different possible phases in market change.
