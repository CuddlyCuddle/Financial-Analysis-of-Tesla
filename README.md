# Introduction
  In this project, I demonstrate basic statistical analysis of stocks using Tesla as an example. For this analysis, a table of basic statistics is created using returns to determine the quality of the stock as an investment. In addition, a small simulation of stock price is conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation assuming that stocks follow a Geometric Distribution.
